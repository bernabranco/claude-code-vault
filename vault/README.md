# Claude Code Vault

Local-first markdown vault for giving Claude persistent context across sessions.

## One folder per project, type-first inside

Each project you work on gets its own top-level folder. Inside that folder, notes are grouped by **type** (adr, design, feature, gotcha, research, go-to-market) — not by audience. An LLM looking for *"why did we pick X"* knows to check `adrs/`; looking for *"what can a free user do"* knows to check `go-to-market/`. Stable folder names mean stable retrieval.

Do not put loose topic folders at the root (`adrs/`, `designs/`, etc.) — they lose their project context. Always nest under a project.

## Folder types

| Folder | What goes here |
|---|---|
| `adrs/` | Architecture Decision Records — why a choice was made, what was rejected, consequences |
| `designs/` | System and component design docs — how something is built |
| `features/` | User-facing feature specs — what the product does, flows, edge cases |
| `gotchas/` | Non-obvious traps that bit you in production; hazards worth reading before touching the code |
| `research/` | Market snapshots, user research, competitive analysis, prior art |
| `go-to-market/` | Pricing, positioning, rollout, sales |
| `runbooks/` | (optional) step-by-step operational procedures — incidents, deploys, backups |

Add folders as needed; skip the ones you don't use.

## Conventions

- **Every project has a `VAULT_SUMMARY.md`** at its root — this is the index Claude reads first.
- **Frontmatter on every note** — see schema below.
- **Wiki-links are project-scoped**: `[[claude-code-vault/gotchas/gotchas]]`, not `[[gotchas]]`. Keeps links unambiguous once you add more projects.
- **Gotchas are first-class** — put non-obvious traps in `gotchas/`, not buried in design docs. They're what Claude needs to surface before suggesting changes.

## Frontmatter schema

All fields are optional except where noted; missing fields fall back to sensible defaults. The parser is additive — older notes keep working.

| Field | Required | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | recommended | string | Falls back to first H1, then file id |
| `tags` | recommended | `[a, b, c]` | Combined with inline `#hashtags` from the body |
| `date` | optional | `YYYY-MM-DD` | When the note was authored. Used by `after`/`before` filters. |
| `description` | optional | string | One-line blurb shown in search results / list views |
| `summary` | optional | string | Longer TL;DR. Falls back to `description` when absent. Future: pinned as chunk-0. |
| `status` | optional | `draft \| current \| stale \| deprecated` | Defaults to `current`. **Drives status-aware retrieval**: `deprecated` notes are excluded from search by default; `stale` notes are downranked by 0.7. |
| `type` | optional | `adr \| feature \| gotcha \| runbook \| glossary \| overview \| architecture \| research` | Enables typed-note schemas (future). Unknown values warn on stderr. |
| `lastVerified` | optional | `YYYY-MM-DD` | Last time the note's claims were checked against reality. Distinct from file mtime. |

## Example frontmatter

```markdown
---
title: My Note Title
tags: [project-name, adr, storage]
date: 2026-04-17
description: One-line summary used in search results and the index
summary: Longer TL;DR — what this note tells you and when to read it
status: current
type: adr
lastVerified: 2026-04-20
---

# Note Content
```

## Status-aware retrieval

All search APIs (`vault.search`, `semanticSearch`, `searchChunks`, and the four MCP search tools) honor the `status` field by default:

- **`status: deprecated`** — excluded from results. The note is still indexed and linkable; it just doesn't surface during search. Pass `includeDeprecated: true` (MCP) or `--include-deprecated` (CLI) to see it.
- **`status: stale`** — kept in results but with similarity (or relevance) multiplied by `staleWeight` (default `0.7`). Tune with `staleWeight: <0..1>` (MCP) or `--stale-weight <n>` (CLI). Setting `1.0` disables the downrank.
- **`status: current`** and **`status: draft`** — unchanged.

The intent: prevent agents from quoting deprecated docs as if they're current, and bias retrieval toward fresher content without hard-excluding stale notes that may still be the best available answer.

## Per-type note schemas

When a note sets `type:`, the linter enforces a minimal body schema for that type. The goal is predictable retrieval — chunks have the same breadcrumbs and bold labels across notes of the same kind, so keyword search finds them and LLMs can scan them consistently.

Scaffold a new note with the right shape via `claude-code-vault add <path> "<title>" --type <t>`.

| Type | Required structure | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `adr` | H2 sections: `## Context`, `## Decision`, `## Alternatives`, `## Consequences` | Standard ADR format; these are the four questions every decision record answers. |
| `feature` | H2 sections: `## What`, `## Why`, `## How` | Enough to explain a user-visible feature without prescribing a rigid template. |
| `runbook` | An `## Steps` H2, and at least one `### Verify` H3 subsection | Every step should be independently verifiable — no blind runbooks. |
| `gotcha` | Each H2 section contains bold labels `**Symptom**`, `**Cause**`, `**Fix**` | Gotchas are scanned under pressure; the labels make the triage info findable. |
| `glossary` | Frontmatter `terms: [A, B, C]` list, and a matching `## A`, `## B`, `## C` H2 for each | Declarative term list lets the linter catch drift between what's declared and what's defined. |
| `overview` / `architecture` / `research` | No body schema — only the universal frontmatter rules apply | These are free-form narrative; forcing structure would hurt more than help. |

Types not in the table above warn as `unknown-type`. See [[claude-code-vault/gotchas/gotchas]] for the full enum.

## Write-back MCP tools

Agents can author notes directly through two MCP tools (the CLI does not currently wrap them — use MCP):

- **`vault_create_note`** — create a new note. Required: `id`, `type`, `title`, `body`. Optional: `tags`, `description`, `summary`, `status` (defaults to `current`). Fails on id collision, missing required fields, unknown status, or unresolved wiki-links in the body. `date` and `lastVerified` are stamped to today.
- **`vault_write`** — update an existing note. `content` may be either full markdown with a leading `---` frontmatter block (merge-patched over existing frontmatter; body replaced) or body-only markdown (existing frontmatter preserved; body replaced). Fails if the note doesn't exist, the body is empty, or the body introduces unresolved wiki-links.
- **`vault_append_section`** — append content to a single heading-section, selected by `headingPath` (strict ancestor chain of heading texts, e.g. `["Gotchas", "Auth retry storm"]`). Content lands after the section's last non-blank body line, before the next same-or-higher heading. The heading and frontmatter are untouched.
- **`vault_replace_section`** — replace the body of a single heading-section (same path semantics). The heading line is preserved verbatim; everything between it and the next same-or-higher heading — including nested subsections — is replaced. Pass an empty `content` to clear the section body. Use this for low-overhead incremental updates (one gotcha, one runbook step) instead of round-tripping the whole note.

All four write tools return `{ note, createdStubs, suggestedLinks }`:

- **`note`** — the written note as read back from disk.
- **`createdStubs`** — ids of any notes auto-created because the body contained unresolved `[[target]]` wiki-links. Each stub starts with `status: draft`, `tags: [stub]`, and a body that backlinks to the source note. Authoring never blocks on chain-of-reference; the agent can fill stubs in later. Invalid id shapes (e.g. `../escape`) still reject.
- **`suggestedLinks`** — bare mentions of known note titles or glossary `terms` that aren't already wiki-linked. Each entry is `{ target, matchedText, matchedOn: "title" | "term", count, firstLine }`. Not auto-inserted — the agent decides.

All four tools write atomically (tmp-file + rename), then reindex the vault and resync embeddings so the write is immediately searchable. Section edits fail on path miss or ambiguous match.

Draft stubs that haven't been filled in after **`staleStubDays`** (default 7) are flagged by the linter with code `stale-stub`. Tune with `--stale-stub-days <n>` (CLI) or `staleStubDays` (MCP `vault_lint`).

Use these to keep agent-authored content subject to the same schema and link-integrity rules as hand-written notes.

## Query-miss log (content-gap discovery)

Turn on with `VAULT_QUERY_LOG=1` in the MCP env. Every call to the four search tools (`vault_search`, `vault_semantic_search`, `vault_search_chunks`, `vault_search_chunks_with_context`) appends one JSONL line to `.vault-cache/query-log.jsonl` with `{ timestamp, tool, query, resultCount, topScore, options }`. Off by default, local-only, gitignored. Rotates at 10 MB — one rotated file (`.jsonl.1`) kept.

The intent: surface queries that found nothing or nothing good, so you can see what content the vault is missing.

Inspect with the CLI:

- `claude-code-vault query-log` — top empty/low-score queries grouped by normalized text
- `claude-code-vault query-log --misses` — chronological miss entries
- `claude-code-vault query-log --tail 20` — last N entries (all, not just misses)
- `claude-code-vault query-log --min-score 0.2` — tune the "nothing good" threshold (default 0.3)
- `claude-code-vault query-log --since 2026-04-01` — only recent entries
- `claude-code-vault query-log --clear` — delete both the active and rotated log

Logging failures are warned once to stderr then silenced for the rest of the process — search results never block on disk I/O.

## Starting a new project

1. `mkdir vault/new-project/`
2. Create `vault/new-project/VAULT_SUMMARY.md` as the index
3. Add type folders as needed (`adrs/`, `designs/`, `features/`, etc.)
4. Point Claude at the new project by saving a memory or adding a line to the project's `CLAUDE.md`

## Web UI (optional)

The React app under `web/` renders the vault as a searchable graph. It needs `lib/server.js` running to index and serve notes. Claude itself does **not** need the backend — it reads markdown directly from disk.
